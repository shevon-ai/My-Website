            <p>
                Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or 
                other two-dimensional surface. Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, 
                various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, 
                pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals.
